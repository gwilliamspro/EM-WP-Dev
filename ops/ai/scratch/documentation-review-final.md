## 4. Recommendations

### Future Documentation Tasks (Not Blocking Commit)

#### 1. Add Visual Diagrams (Low Priority)
**Suggested Additions**:
- State transition diagram (before cutoff → after cutoff → closed)
- Settings page screenshot
- Frontend countdown example screenshot
- Timeline diagram for next-open-day calculation

**Rationale**: Documentation is text-heavy but complete. Visual aids would enhance understanding but are not critical.

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (design and capture screenshots)

---

#### 2. Create Quick Start Guide (Low Priority)
**Suggested File**: `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/epic-marks-blocks/QUICKSTART.md`

**Contents**:
- 5-minute setup guide
- Basic configuration (cutoff time only)
- How to insert block
- How to test countdown
- Link to full README for advanced features

**Rationale**: README is comprehensive (731 lines) but could be overwhelming for new users. Quick start guide would provide fast onboarding.

**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

---

#### 3. Create Admin User Documentation (Medium Priority)
**Suggested File**: `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/epic-marks-blocks/ADMIN-GUIDE.md`

**Contents**:
- Non-technical language
- Screenshot walkthrough of settings page
- Common configuration scenarios
- FAQ for business owners
- No code examples or technical details

**Rationale**: Current README is developer-focused. Admin guide would be useful for non-technical WordPress admins.

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

---

### Maintenance Notes

#### Documentation Update Schedule
- **Weekly**: Update holiday dates if needed
- **Monthly**: Review troubleshooting section for new issues
- **Quarterly**: Full documentation review and accuracy check
- **After Plugin Update**: Update version numbers and changelog

#### Version Control Best Practices
- Tag documentation with git tags matching plugin versions
- Create dated backups before major documentation rewrites
- Use conventional commit messages for documentation changes:
  - `docs: add countdown timer configuration examples`
  - `docs: update troubleshooting section with timezone issues`
  - `docs: clarify WP-CLI commands for settings changes`

#### Stale Content Monitoring
Watch for these indicators of stale documentation:
- Version numbers not matching plugin header
- TODO markers appearing in docs
- User-reported issues not in troubleshooting section
- WP-CLI commands failing (changed container name, etc.)
- Browser compatibility list outdated (new major browser versions)
