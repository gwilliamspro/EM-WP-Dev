# Session Operating Rules (apply in every future thread)
- Keep the working set tiny: touch ≤6 files/ops per phase. If more, propose phases.
- Always start by restating the relevant invariants and the files we'll touch in ≤10 bullets.
- Use the roles pipeline: Architect → Implementer → Tester → Librarian.
- End each phase with a 10–15 line recap: changed files, commands, risks, next step.
- If context gets fuzzy, request to start a fresh thread using the recap + invariants.
